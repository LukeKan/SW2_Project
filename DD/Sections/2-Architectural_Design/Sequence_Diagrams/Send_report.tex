This sequence diagram represents the process of the basic functionality of the app, that is to say the send report function. As soon as the user taps on the new report icon the app opens the camera interface so that the user can take the picture of the violation. Once the picture has been taken the app automatically gather from the phone the required data that need to be associated with the report, such as: GPS coordinates, date and time. Then a page that contains such data and a preview of the picture is shown to the user. In order to send a valid report he must also choose,     from a list of violation category, the one that best suits the event; ultimately he can choose to modify the information as he wants (i.e. retake picture, change address, etc ...).
