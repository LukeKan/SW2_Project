\subsection{Reliability}
The system needs to always be online in order to correctly store and 
manage violation reports and to be robust in case of failures. These 
requirements can be guaranteed through a virtual replication of the 
backend system: a possible solution
could be implemented through Docker containers managed by a container
orchestrion such as Kubernetes or DockerCompose. The container architecture
automatically restarts containers in case of failures (fault tollerant)
guaranteeing the system functioning in every situation.
\subsection{Availability}
As previously stated, the system must always guarantee an operating service of
violation reports. Thus, the system has to be available 
under stressing condition of an high number of users.
\subsection{Security}
As the data transferred and stored in the SafeStreets system deals with
private citizen's data, it must be guaranteed an high level of security.
In order to meet the GDPR conditions, all data has to be correctly 
encrypted through several security methods before being sent and stored.
\subsection{Maintainability}
The software maintainability is one of the most critical aspect in the
development of this software. In order to allow cheap and easy fix, SafeStreets
is developed by using several design patterns that make the software
flexible and scalable. Such patterns can be recognized both in the previous
UML class diagram and in further documents.
\subsection{Portability}
SafeStreets is intended to work on every mobile device, thus the technologies
used for its development have to be cross-platform (such as Flutter or any other
language which can generate applications for IOS and Android systems).
