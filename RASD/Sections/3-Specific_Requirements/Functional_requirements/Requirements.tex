      \item {[R22]}: The Web application allows both the LSA and the PTs to change the status of reports (i.e. from "PENDING" to "SOLVED");
      \item {[D13]}: The police corporates and technicians can manage only the violation reports that belong to their jurisdiction;
      \item {[D14]}: The police technicians can only take care of the violations which are assigned to them by the police corporate;

      \item {[R25]}: The Web application provides a section that can be used by both LSA and PTs to visualize statistics/metrics about the data;
      \item {[R26]}: The system must offer some functionalities to calculate the most useful statistics/metrics related to the data;
    \end{itemize}
    
  \item \textbf{{[G7]}: If the municipality offers a service that provides data about car accidents then the system must be able to cross this information with its owns data in order to identify possible unsafe areas;}
