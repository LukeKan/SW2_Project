In order to promptly tackle violations that are reported,
SafeStreets has to be a low latency service: police technicians have
to intervene quickly, in order to fine the transgressors before they
leave the scene of the violation. Also, the system has to guarantee an
efficient service to an high number of users and police technician connected
simultaneously.
