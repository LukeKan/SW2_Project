\subsection{User Interfaces}
This section shows a mockup version of the main functionalities of the mobile application and the web application of the final version of SafeStreets.
\begin{itemize}
    \item Mobile application:
            \begin{itemize}
                \item LogIn interface
                \item Violation report form
                \item History section
                \item Map section
            \end{itemize}
    \item Web application;
            \begin{itemize}
                \item Login interface
                \item Violation reports page
                \item Specific report page
                \item Report mining page
                \item Statistics page
            \end{itemize}
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Hardware Interfaces}
SafeStreets do not require any specific hardware device, 
thus there are no hardware interfaces to other existing systems
\subsection{Software Interfaces}
SafeStreets is a standalone service and does not share any API to 
external systems. However, the system requires the interaction with the 
Image recognition service and with the municipality's legacy system
to perform its tasks. \newline
The software requires a standard format in order to retrieve car accident
data from the municipality's system. Such standard will be specified more 
in details in the DD.
\subsection{Comunication Interfaces}
External services are not allowed to interact actively with SafeStreets, therefore
the system does not offer any comunication interface to external systems.
