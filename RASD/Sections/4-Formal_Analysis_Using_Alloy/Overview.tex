In this	section an analysis of some critical aspects of the system is provided exploiting Alloy.	
The	focus is on	some static	constraints, in	particular:	
\begin{itemize}
    \item Uniqueness of usernames and every other univoque parameter of the system, such as plates, violationIds and so on;
    \item Users can only mine information concerning MDS and not Plates. Also they cannot explicitly query reports that has been performed by other users.
    \item LSAs can deal only with violation occured in their competence area and thus scheduling such violations to the technician that they manage;
    \item SuggestedIntervention can be generated only if at least one violation occured in the same location of the suggestion.
\end{itemize}
Other constraints are specified for keeping a steady structure of the alloy model, in order to avoid dangling entities and preserving foreign constraints.\newline
Four different worlds have been generated in order to verify the correctness of the constraints.
