The purpose of this Requirement Analysis and Specification Document (RASD)
is to provide a detailed description about the software SafeStreets that we wish
to develop. In particular this document is focused on important aspects that are
useful during the design of the software architecture like: scope, functional and
non-functional requirements, use cases and scenarios, constraints and assumption, class/sequence diagrams, limitation and interfaces with other softwares.
Overall the document is a useful guide for the developers that will have to follow
and implement all the necessary requirements, nevertheless itâ€™s also a document
that can be given to potential customers to get them an idea of what the software
will be like.
